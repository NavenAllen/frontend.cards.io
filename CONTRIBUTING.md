## Reporting Bugs and Issues

We use [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/NavenAllen/frontend.cards.io/issues) to track bugs, so please do a search before submitting to ensure your problem isn't already tracked.

### New Issues

Please provide the expected and observed behaviours in your issue.

## Proposing a Change

If you intend to implement a feature, or make a non-trivial change to the current implementation, we recommend [first filing an issue](https://github.com/NavenAllen/frontend.cards.io/issues/new) marked with the `proposal` tag, so that the maintainers can provide guidance and feedback on the direction of an implementation.  This also help ensure that other people aren't also working on the same thing.

Bug fixes are also welcome, but please specify the nature before and after fixing the bug in your pull request.
